| ---- | ----------- |


## Examples

```c
public OnGameModeInit()
{
    DisableInteriorEnterExits();
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

::: tip

This function will only work if it has been used BEFORE a player connects (it is recommended to use it in OnGameModeInit). It will not remove a connected player's markers.

:::

::: warning

If the gamemode is changed after this function has been used, and the new gamemode doesn't disable markers, the markers will NOT reappear for already-connected players (but will for newly connected players).
