```c
new Text:MyTextdraw;
Â 
public OnGameModeInit()
{
    MyTextDraw = TextDrawCreate(100.0, 33.0,"Example TextDraw");
    TextDrawSetProportional(MyTextDraw,1);

## Notes

::: tip

Proportionality is set to 1 by default, you might skip this function if you don't want to disable it.
If you want to change the proportionality of a textdraw that is already shown, you don't have to recreate it. Simply use TextDrawShowForPlayer/TextDrawShowForAll after modifying the textdraw and the change will be visible.
